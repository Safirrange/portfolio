            `This project is currently a work in progress, developed as part of my 3rd year, 2nd semester. Although incomplete, it’s already a reflection of how far I’ve come by applying lessons from past projects, guidance from seniors, and (finally) some real instruction from our professors.
                <br><br>
                Compared to my previous works, I’ve made several key improvements:
                <br> - Separate user and admin accounts for better security and role management.
                <br> - Cleaner UI design and a more intuitive user experience.
                <br> - Improved data handling — instead of dumping everything at once, I’m now using pagination to manage large datasets.
                <br> - Thoughtful feature additions aimed at making the platform easier and more useful for users.
                
                <br><br>However, this project also taught me a major lesson: the importance of planning. Like many of my past works, I jumped into coding without a clear roadmap, thinking I’d “figure it out later.” That mindset led to scheduling issues, rushed decisions, and most notably — a messy database structure with too many tables and unnecessary relationships. It became clear how much time and efficiency can be lost without solid preparation.
                <br><br>If there’s one takeaway from this project, it’s this: Always plan ahead — not just what features to build, but how everything will connect and evolve.`,

            ` This project was a huge learning experience for me in terms of creating a fully functioning website and understanding the logic behind databases.
            It marked the first time I used an AI chatbot, and the first time I built a project entirely on my own without following any tutorials — though I did use "Airpaz.com" as a reference.
            It was my introduction to events, relational structures, tokens, and database calculations. 
            I also encountered APIs for the first time, which taught me a valuable lesson: APIs are not cheap! I spent a lot of time creating different accounts just to get 50 more free refreshes.
            
            <br><br>Additionally, I learned how a mailing system works — allowing users to send messages to admins, using email for account activation, and checking for duplicate accounts. 
            I also gained a deeper understanding of web design and the importance of tools like Figma (or any wireframing tool) to map out designs before jumping into coding.
            Lastly, I learned a bit about chatbbots and how they can be integrated into a website.
            
            <br><br>The biggest lesson I learned, however, was not to overestimate myself. 
            Despite having two months to complete the project, I thought it would be easy — but I was wrong. 
            The payment system, in particular, caused me to get stuck for weeks. 
            I tried to understand it and implement it, but ultimately, I couldn’t finish that feature. 
            This project, while incomplete, became a major learning experience and a reminder to manage expectations and not rush through complex tasks.`,

            <br><br>This project marked my first hands-on experience with backend development using PHP. 
            I followed a YouTube tutorial to build a blogging platform where content creators can share anything about their lives.
            While it started as a guided walkthrough, it quickly became a deeper learning experience. 
            <br><br>Along the way, I encountered unexpected bugs and errors not covered in the tutorial.
            This challenged me to step out of the “copy-and-follow” mindset and develop real problem-solving skills. 
            I learned how to debug effectively, trace issues, and build an understanding of how different components of a web application interact.
            <br><br>This project taught me that tutorials are just starting points — true learning happens when things go wrong, and you figure out how to fix them.`,

            You’ll mostly see screenshots here, as many of the original files are now gone — but there’s a story, and a big lesson I want to share.

            <br><br>You might be wondering, "Why isn’t this at the very beginning of your project list?" 
            That’s because this section is more of a graveyard — a place for lost code, unrecovered files, and forgotten folders.

            <br><br>ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR FILES!

            <br><br>Back then, I was working on a 2D game — about 30% complete — with my own custom assets. 
            Everything was stored on one external hard drive, and only there. 
            Eventually, due to age and wear, the HDD started slowing down and then completely failed.
            It just stopped working one day, and there was no way to recover anything from it. 
            That drive held all my Java projects and my early experiments. Losing everything in an instant was my first real heartbreak as a developer.

            <br><br>Since then, I’ve never made the same mistake again. 
            Now, I always back up my files — because no matter how small or early a project feels, it might mean everything later on.`,
